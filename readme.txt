To compile and run it, download Qooxdoo SDK from "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-5.0.1-sdk.zip" and unpack it to "qooxdoo-5.0.1-sdk" directory here (e.g. directories at a root of the project must be "DemoApplication", "qooxdoo-5.0.1-sdk" and "source").
Also you must download and install ActivePython from "http://www.activestate.com/activepython-3".
Now open qxDotNet.sln in Visual Studio 2015 and run "DemoApplication" project.
